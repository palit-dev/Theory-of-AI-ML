## Type 1 and Type 2 Error
In statistics, a Type I error is a false positive conclusion, while a Type II error is a false negative conclusion.

### Example: Type I vs Type II error

* **Type I error (false positive):** the test result says you have coronavirus, but you actually don’t.
* **Type II error (false negative):** the test result says you don’t have coronavirus, but you actually do.
